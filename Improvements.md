# Improvements

Suggested improvements for the solution (high-level, implementation ideas and priorities):

1) Visualize the robot on a map
   - What: Show the room and robot position/direction on a grid (ASCII in console, terminal UI, web, or desktop GUI).
   - Why: Makes results immediately clear and helps debugging/teaching use cases.
   - How: 
     - Quick: ASCII map in console (render after each command sequence).
     - Medium: Terminal UI using Terminal.Gui or curses-style rendering for interactive control and redraw.
     - Rich: Web UI (Blazor/React) or desktop (WPF/WinForms) for clickable controls and persistent visualization.

2) Control with arrow keys
   - What: Support interactive keyboard control using arrow keys to move/rotate the robot in real time.
   - Why: Improves interactivity and manual exploration of behaviors.
   - How:
     - Console: Console.ReadKey(intercept: true) to capture arrows (map to commands). Consider special handling for platforms/terminals.
     - Terminal UI: use a library that normalizes key events across platforms.
     - Web/GUI: standard key event handlers.

3) Provide immediate feedback when pressing keys
   - What: Update visualization or textual status instantly when a control key is pressed.
   - Why: Better UX for interactive mode.
   - How: Redraw map or print transient status lines; debounce or queue events in an async loop; use CancellationToken for clean shutdown.

4) Clearer input modes / selection of input source
   - What: Make it explicit/easier to choose input mode (stdin pipe, single-line argument, interactive/manual), add help and validation.
   - Why: Reduces confusion and errors; improves discoverability.
   - How:
     - Add CLI flags (e.g. --single "..." , --stdin, --interactive) and a --help output.
     - Improve README with examples for each mode and platform-specific tips.
     - Validate inputs early and provide helpful error messages and sample valid input.
